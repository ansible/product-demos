## About These Demos
This category of demos shows examples of network operations and management with Ansible Automation Platform. The list of demos can be found below. See the [Suggested Usage](#suggested-usage) section of this document for recommendations on how to best use these demos.
- [**NETWORK / Configuration**](https://github.com/nleiva/ansible-net-modules/blob/main/main.yml) - Deploy golden configurations for different resources to Cisco IOS, IOSXR, and NXOS.

### Project

These demos leverage playbooks from a [git repo](https://github.com/nleiva/ansible-net-modules) that is added as the **`Network Golden Configs`** Project in your Ansible Controller. Review this repo for the playbooks to configure different resources and network config templates that will be configured.

### Inventory

These demos leverage "always-on" instances for Cisco IOS, IOSXR, and NXOS from [Cisco DevNet Sandboxes](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/sandbox/#!getting-started/always-on-sandboxes). These instances are shared and do not provide admin access but they are instantly avaible all the time meaning not setup time is required.

A **`Network Inventory`** is created when setting up these demos and a dynamic source is added to populate the Always-On instances. Review the inventory file [here](https://github.com/nleiva/ansible-net-modules/blob/main/hosts).

## Suggested Usage

**NETWORK / Configuration** - Use this job to execute different [Ansible Network Resource Modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_resource_modules.html) to deploy golden configs. Below is a list of the different resources the can be configured with a link to their golden config.

**NETWORK / Backups to Gitlab** - Use this job-template to backup network device configurations to a Gitlab repository.

***This demo requires the following pre-requisite items!***
You will be prompted by a survey for the following information:
- [Create a Gitlab Account](https://gitlab.com)
- [Create a new project named 'backups'](https://gitlab.com/projects/new)
- Create a project token for your account. This step requires your own unique Gitlab username. https://gitlab.com/username/backups/-/settings/access_tokens

At this point you should have a project url similar to this:
https://gitlab.com/username/backups

You can view and delete your config files by accessing your own gitlab project url.
