# GOALS

## Why does the Ansible Product Demos (APD) project exist?

The Ansible Product Demos (APD) project is a field-driven repository of common, reusable AAP config-as-code content meant to be used for demos and proof-of-concept scenarios.

## Who is the audience for APD?

The main audience for APD are people in a technical pre-sales role who want to demo AAP capabilities to customers.

Pre-sales personas include:
- Account Solution Architects - Run simple demos for customers
- Automation Specialists - Run more complex demos, or use APD as example content for hackathons, PoCs, etc.

A long-term goal is to ensure all APD content is solid enough to allow a customer to install the demos in their environment and use the workflows and job templates with confidence.

Customer personas include:
- Customers evaluating AAP who want pre-built content to explore

## What are the project goals?

### Primary Goals
- Build a curated set of demos that are widely impactful and reusable
- Keep existent content well-maintained and up-to-date
- Support a target environment of demo.redhat.com for Red Hat technical sellers and partners

### Secondary Goals
- target environment of a customer environment where installation and configuration may be slightly different than demo.redhat.com
- Create additional impactful demos that can be reused across multiple customer accounts
